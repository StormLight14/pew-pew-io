## What is this?
A 2D counter-strike clone.

## How do I host a server for others to join?
Either use the GUI and press host game, or run the binary from the command line with the headless flag if you don't want to display anything. (ex: `./pew-pew-io.x86_64 -- --headless`)

If 10 players connect the game will auto start; there is currently no way to change this number besides from the code. (TODO: allow changing this number from the GUI or with a command line argument)
